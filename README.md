Workshop Utilities for R contains utility functions for planning and
conducting R workshops in a virtual environment. These include:

-   Create custom HTML summary reports from a Google Form survey (i.e.,
    workshop registration)

-   Plot online PNG and JPG images in RStudio with a single function, as
    a kind of popup slide that can be embedded within a workshop R
    script

-   *Coming soon:* Create HTML pages containing hints and tips,
    populated by a Google Sheet, that can be embedded in a R Notebook as
    hints and solutions. Option to create bitly links.
